### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub page. 

I'm currently a sophomore, majoring in Software Engineering. I have a huge knack for algorithm design and data structures.

I'm a leader of VNOI technical team. We built a [Vietnames Online Judge](http://oj.vnoi.info/) with over 150 000 monthly page views, you can check its repo [here](https://github.com/VNOI-Admin/OJ)
